# Project 1: Client-side Game

## Overview

Your first WDI project will start out with something fun - **a game!**

Thanks to the amount of logic there is in a game, there's no better app than a game to teach you how to **think like a programmer**!

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**.  You got your feet wet
with Tic-Tac-Toe, now it's time to step it up a notch.

**You will be working individually for this project**. However, your instructors and instructor assistants will be guiding you along with up to ten 15-minute one-on-one sessions.  Be sure to use them wisely :).

As a reminder, your project's code **must be substantially yours**. **Do not copy code from other similar projects or other sources** However, using  lines of code from  StackOverflow to accomplish general techniques/algorithms is okay - an example would be using StackOverflow as a source for code that replaces a character at a certain position in a string. 

Lastly, after presenting your projects next Friday, you will be completing a Unit 1 Code Challenge (more in a bit).

## Technical Requirements

### Due this Thursday Morning:

You will share:

- Your choice of game.
- A wireframe of your "main" game screen.
- Pseudocode for the overall game play.
- Optional: Additional wireframes and/or pseudocode of specific functionality.

### Your App (presented next Friday) must:

- Render a game in the browser.
- **Include win and/or loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.
- **Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files**.
- Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, ensure that your vertical whitespace is consistent.
- No remaining **dead (code that will never be called) and/or commented out code**.
- Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)**. Don't attempt to implement a computer opponent.  This typically requires AI which is beyond the scope of WDI.
- Write **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
- **Use native Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** - your choice. However be consistent - it's not wise to mix & match the two approaches to accomplish similar tasks.
- **Deploy your game online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## Necessary Deliverables

- **A ``README.md`` file** with these sections at a minimum:
  1. **\<Your game's title\>**: A description of your game.  Background info of the game is a nice touch.
  1. **A screenshot** or screenshots of your actual game makes your readme more colorful :)
  1. **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.
  1. **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important. 
  1. **Next Steps**: Unsolved problems and/or planned features.
- The code for **a working game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub Pages (covered next week).
- Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit often, but don't commit broken code (unless instructed to do so for sharing with instructors, etc.). Also, commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board".

> Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well done `README.md`. The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and will therefore go towards forming their first impression of your work!

### Choose From the Following Games

> Note: Games are listed in approximate order of increasing difficulty.

1. **Connect Four**
1. **War** (the card game)
1. **Blackjack**
1. **Simon** (warning: will require asynchronous timing)
1. **Slot Machine**
1. **Mancala**
1. **Minesweeper**
1. **Othello/Reversi**
1. **Checkers** (no AI required - player vs. player instead)
1. **Solitaire**
1. **Battleship** (would require a little AI to implement a computer opponent)

**If you have a game not on the list that you'd like to code, please be sure to get approval from your instructor!**

## Suggestions

- If you choose a card-based game, there is a CSS library in the _resources_ directory of the class repo that will help you render **beautiful** cards of any size, front and back.
- **Following the guidelines and principles in the** [Guide to Building a Browser App](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/6f1919291f6007b2c0b2c93d925d6bac) will help you write code that follows a data-centric/MVC approach, which results in clearer, more concise code that can scale.
- **Begin by wireframing.** Think generally about how you'd
  like your game to look.
- **Pseudocode**. Think about how your game will work.  Ponder what a player does or might do when interacting with your game and how the code must respond.
- **Use your Development Tools** (`console.log`, DevTools' debugger, `alert` statements) to debug and solve issues.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Donâ€™t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation and other resources** to better understand methods, etc.
- **Theme your game** to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!
- Be sure to review the [Peer Code Review Checklist](./p1-peer-code-review.md) for important tips - your code will be evaluated using this checklist.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If there are deficiencies in meeting the requirements, you will be given guidance on what needs to be done to meet the requirements.  Your updated project will be due **9am** Monday morning following demo Friday.
- After your presentation, your instructor may provide you with feedback that will benefit your project and perhaps the projects of other students as well.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide additional feedback, please ask!
- After project presentations, there will be a "Unit 1 Code Challenge".

---

## Unit 1 Code Challenge

After all presentations are complete, you will be assigned a Unit 1 Code Challenge.

The goal of the challenge is to gauge your ability to develop a **minimal** front-end web application using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, including your ability to:

- Write HTML that provides the app's overall structure and content. 
- Use CSS to provide styling.
- Use JavaScript to:
	- Define variables that hold application state, cache DOM elements, etc.
	- Select elements in the DOM and assign them to variables.
	- Listen for browser events, such as `click`, being dispatched by DOM elements.
	- Manipulate a DOM element's content and style. 

You will work on the challenge individually, however, the challenge is "open book", so you will have access to all notes, code, lessons, google, etc.

The Unit 1 Code Challenge will begin shortly after project presentations.  It is anticipated that it will take 30 - 60 minutes to complete.
