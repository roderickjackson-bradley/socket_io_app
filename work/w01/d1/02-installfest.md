# WDI Install Fest

We'll be installing the following tools.

* Slack
* Homebrew
* VS Code
* Git
* Node
* PostgreSQL
* Python
* Django

## Slack

We will be using slack to communicate throughout the course. You will receive an invite to the relevant channels via e-mail. You can login via the web browser, but downloading / installing the app is highly recommended.

[Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)

Remember to drag the Slack app into the Applications folder when you open the downloaded archive.

## Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager that we will use to install various command line tools in our class.

Open up terminal, and paste the following command to install Homebrew. You might be prompted to install XCode Command Line Tools during the install process.

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

If you are prompted to install the XCode CLI, say yes and your homebrew installation will continue.

After the installation process, run the command `brew doctor`. If any warnings or errors are displayed, we will need to resolve them before proceeding with the rest of the install fest.

Lastly, make sure to run `brew update` to make sure you have the latest lists of available software.

## Xcode

We do not use Xcode in class but some other applications that we do use require some Xcode libraries. Normally, all you need is the Xcode CLI which should have already been installed when you installed Homebrew. If it didn't get installed, you can use this command:

```
xcode-select --install
```

If you need to, you can install Xcode through the App Store. (You probably don't need to.) [Link here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)


## Visual Studio Code

Text editors are a personal choice. One of the most popular open source text editors these days, for good reason, is Visual Studio Code.

> Note: VS Code's _keyboard shortcuts_ are different than the shortcuts used by the Sublime or Atom editors. If you already know Sublime's shortcuts and don't want to learn those of VS Code, it's possible to configure VS Code to use Sublime's.

Download and install VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Important: Be sure that VS Code is in your Mac's `Applications` folder.

Launch a terminal, and you should be able to open a folder to edit by typing `code .`

Check [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) for troubleshooting if you run into issues.

## Git

Git is the version control software we will be using - it's extremely popular.

You should have already installed Git as instructed to complete the pre-work.

If it's not installed, we can use Homebrew to install it:

```
brew install git
```

#### Github

[Github](https://github.com/) provides a way to host Git repos in the cloud.  It enables collaboration and is wildly popular.

You should have already opened a personal Github account, however, you need to have a General Assembly Github Enterprise account as well.  You can get one by signing up here:  [https://git.generalassemb.ly/](https://git.generalassemb.ly/)

#### Configuring a Global git ignore

Everyone should have a global **git ignore** file so that you don’t have to worry about making the appropriate entries in a project’s git ignore.

First, create the file:  `touch ~/.gitignore_global`

Next, configure git to use this file:  `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`

Finally, lets put some good stuff in there:

```sh

## Node

Node is a JavaScript engine for the backend. We use it to power our web servers and connect to our databases.

```
brew install node
```

Verify the installation afterwards by running:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

The above commands should display versions without any errors. To verify that all the required permissions are set correctly, try to install a package such as the useful _nodemon_ globally:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

## PostgreSQL

Install the **PostgreSQL** database mangement system (DBMS) using Homebrew with this command:

```
brew install postgresql
```

After Postgres is installed run this command:

```
brew services start postgresql
```
 
Followed by this command to test the install by creating a new database named the same as the current system user:
 
```
createdb
```

## Installing MongoDB

Install **MongoDB** using Homebrew with this command:

```
brew install mongodb
```

Now create the directory where your MongoDB data will be stored:

```
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
```

Be sure you include the leading slash in front of `/data/db`.

Now let's get your username:

```
whoami
```

Grant permission to your data directory:

```
sudo chown -R <your username here> /data/db
```

### Testing the MongoDB server

You start the Mongo database server with the following command:
```
mongod
```

Press `control-c` to stop the server.

If you prefer not to have to start/stop MongoDB while working with it in class, you can run this command to ensure the MongoDB engine is running at all times:

```
brew services start mongodb
```

> Note that having the MongoDB process continuously running does consume system resources, so you may be better off manually starting/stopping MongoDB if you have an older (slower) computer.

## Installing Python 3

Brew is also used to install Python 3. (Python 2 is already installed on your Mac.)

Install **Python** using Homebrew with this command: `brew install python`. 

You can test the installation by running `python3 --version`.

Python 3's package manager, `pip3` should have automatically been installed with Python 3.  Test that it was installed by running `pip3 --version`.


## Installing Django

We will use `pip3` to install Django, a robust web framework for Python. We will be installing the latest version (2.x.x):

```
pip3 install Django
```

## Installing Spectacle

Install [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for resizing windows.

This free "productivity" tool is invaluable when it comes to minimizing the time spent sizing windows using the mouse.

## Installing Imgur

Create an account on [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) and install [mac2imgur](https://github.com/mileswd/mac2imgur) to ease uploading screenshots and other images from your computer to your imgur account.
